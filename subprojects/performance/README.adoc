= Performance

This subproject contains two sets of performance related tests, compiler tests
and benchmarks.

== Compiler Performance Tests

The compiler tests can be run using the following Gradle task:

    ./gradlew :perf:performanceTests

This will compile various source files using several past versions of Apache
Groovy in addition to the current source version.

== Benchmarks

JMH Benchmarks can be run using:

    ./gradlew :perf:jmh

In order to run the benchmarks against InvokeDynamic generated classes use
the `indy` property:

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true :perf:jmh

Groovy and Java sources placed in `src/test` will also be available to the
benchmarks.

To run a single benchmark or a matched set of benchmarks, use the
`benchInclude` property:

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=CallsiteBench :perf:jmh

The `benchInclude` property will perform a partial match against package
names or class names. It is equivalent to `.*${benchInclude}.*`.

== InvokeDynamic Performance Benchmarks

A set of benchmarks specifically designed to investigate and isolate performance
issues with Groovy's invokedynamic implementation. See `INDY_PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md`
for the full testing plan and background.

=== Available Benchmark Suites

==== Cold Call Benchmarks (`ColdCallBench`)

Measures the cost of method invocations before callsites are optimized.
This is critical for web applications where objects are created per-request.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=ColdCallBench :perf:jmh

==== Warmup Behavior Benchmarks (`WarmupBehaviorBench`)

Tests performance at different warmup levels (10, 100, 1000, 10000+ calls)
to understand how the optimization threshold affects performance.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=WarmupBehavior :perf:jmh

==== Threshold Sensitivity Benchmarks (`ThresholdSensitivityBench`)

Tests different usage patterns (web request, batch processing, mixed) to
understand which patterns benefit from different threshold configurations.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=ThresholdSensitivity :perf:jmh

==== Cache Invalidation Benchmarks (`CacheInvalidationBench`)

Tests polymorphic dispatch scenarios that cause inline cache invalidation,
addressing issues described in GROOVY-8298.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=CacheInvalidation :perf:jmh

==== Property Access Benchmarks (`PropertyAccessBench`)

Tests GORM-like property access patterns common in Grails applications.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=PropertyAccess :perf:jmh

==== Memory Allocation Benchmarks (`MemoryAllocationBench`)

Measures heap growth and allocation rates during Groovy operations.
Quantifies the memory overhead of MethodHandleWrapper AtomicLong objects
and CacheableCallSite LRU cache entries.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=MemoryAllocation :perf:jmh

For detailed allocation profiling with GC metrics:

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=MemoryAllocation :perf:jmh -Pjmh.profilers=gc

==== Callsite Growth Benchmarks (`CallsiteGrowthBench`)

Measures how memory grows as unique callsites accumulate. Tests with
parameterized callsite counts (100, 1000, 10000) to quantify the ~32 bytes
per cached method handle overhead.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=CallsiteGrowth :perf:jmh

==== Long-Running Session Benchmarks (`LongRunningSessionBench`)

Simulates web application memory patterns over time: request cycles,
sustained load, and memory recovery after GC.

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=LongRunningSession :perf:jmh

=== Memory Pressure Analysis

To compare memory overhead between indy and non-indy modes:

    # Capture non-indy baseline
    ./gradlew -Pindy=false -PbenchInclude=Memory :perf:jmh > noindy-memory.txt

    # Capture indy memory profile
    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=Memory :perf:jmh > indy-memory.txt

    # Compare results
    diff noindy-memory.txt indy-memory.txt

For comprehensive memory analysis with GC profiler:

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=Memory :perf:jmh -Pjmh.profilers=gc

=== Comparing Indy vs Non-Indy

Run the same benchmark with and without invokedynamic to measure the overhead:

    # With invokedynamic (Groovy 4 default)
    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=ColdCallBench :perf:jmh

    # Without invokedynamic (classic bytecode)
    ./gradlew -Pindy=false -PbenchInclude=ColdCallBench :perf:jmh

=== Tuning Thresholds

The invokedynamic implementation has configurable thresholds:

- `groovy.indy.optimize.threshold` (default: 10000) - Calls before optimization
- `groovy.indy.fallback.threshold` (default: 10000) - Fallbacks before reset

Test with different thresholds using JVM arguments:

    ./gradlew -Pindy=true -PbenchInclude=ThresholdSensitivity :perf:jmh \
        --jvmArgs="-Dgroovy.indy.optimize.threshold=100"
