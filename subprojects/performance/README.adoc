= Performance

This subproject contains performance tests and JMH benchmarks for Apache Groovy,
with a particular focus on investigating invokedynamic performance characteristics.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Run all benchmarks
./gradlew :performance:jmh

# Run specific benchmark suite
./gradlew -PbenchInclude=ColdCall :performance:jmh
----

== Compiler Performance Tests

The compiler tests can be run using the following Gradle task:

    ./gradlew :performance:performanceTests

This will compile various source files using several past versions of Apache
Groovy in addition to the current source version.

== Benchmarks

JMH Benchmarks can be run using:

    ./gradlew :performance:jmh

To run a single benchmark or a matched set of benchmarks, use the
`benchInclude` property:

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=CallsiteBench :performance:jmh

The `benchInclude` property will perform a partial match against package
names or class names. It is equivalent to `.*${benchInclude}.*`.

== InvokeDynamic Performance Benchmarks

A comprehensive set of benchmarks designed to investigate and isolate performance
characteristics of Groovy's invokedynamic implementation. See `INDY_PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md`
for the full testing plan and background.

=== Phase 1: Core Performance Benchmarks

==== Cold Call Benchmarks (`ColdCallBench`)

Measures the cost of method invocations before callsites are optimized.
Critical for web applications where objects are created per-request.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=ColdCallBench :performance:jmh

==== Warmup Behavior Benchmarks (`WarmupBehaviorBench`)

Tests performance at different warmup levels (10, 100, 1000, 10000+ calls)
to understand how the optimization threshold affects performance.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=WarmupBehavior :performance:jmh

==== Threshold Sensitivity Benchmarks (`ThresholdSensitivityBench`)

Tests different usage patterns (web request, batch processing, mixed) to
understand which patterns benefit from different threshold configurations.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=ThresholdSensitivity :performance:jmh

==== Cache Invalidation Benchmarks (`CacheInvalidationBench`)

Tests polymorphic dispatch scenarios that cause inline cache invalidation,
addressing issues described in GROOVY-8298.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=CacheInvalidation :performance:jmh

==== Property Access Benchmarks (`PropertyAccessBench`)

Tests GORM-like property access patterns common in Grails applications.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=PropertyAccess :performance:jmh

==== Memory Allocation Benchmarks (`MemoryAllocationBench`)

Measures heap growth and allocation rates during Groovy operations.
Quantifies the memory overhead of MethodHandleWrapper AtomicLong objects
and CacheableCallSite LRU cache entries.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=MemoryAllocation :performance:jmh

For detailed allocation profiling with GC metrics:

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=MemoryAllocation :performance:jmh -Pjmh.profilers=gc

==== Callsite Growth Benchmarks (`CallsiteGrowthBench`)

Measures how memory grows as unique callsites accumulate. Tests with
parameterized callsite counts (100, 1000, 10000) to quantify the ~32 bytes
per cached method handle overhead.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=CallsiteGrowth :performance:jmh

==== Long-Running Session Benchmarks (`LongRunningSessionBench`)

Simulates web application memory patterns over time: request cycles,
sustained load, and memory recovery after GC.

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=LongRunningSession :performance:jmh

=== Phase 2: Grails-Realistic Scenario Tests

These benchmarks simulate real-world Grails application patterns.

==== Request Lifecycle Benchmarks (`RequestLifecycleBench`)

Simulates full HTTP request lifecycle in a Grails-like application:

* Controller receives request (params parsing)
* Service layer invocation (transactional context)
* Domain object manipulation (property access, validation)
* Model building for view

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=RequestLifecycle :performance:jmh

==== Template Render Benchmarks (`TemplateRenderBench`)

Simulates GSP-like template rendering with heavy property access:

* Property access on model objects (`${person.name}`)
* Collection iteration (`g:each`)
* GString interpolation
* Spread operators (`people*.name`)

    ./gradlew -PbenchInclude=TemplateRender :performance:jmh

==== Mini-Grails Domain Model

The `grailslike` package contains realistic domain classes:

* `DomainObject` - Base class with dirty tracking, validation
* `Person`, `Order`, `OrderItem` - E-commerce entities
* `User`, `Role`, `Customer`, `Product` - Additional domain classes
* `DynamicService` - Service with methodMissing for dynamic finders
* `TransactionalSimulator` - Transaction boundary simulation
* `ControllerSimulator` - Request handling patterns
* `TemplateSimulator` - GSP-like rendering

=== Threshold Parameter Sweep

Test multiple threshold values to find optimal settings:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :performance:jmhThresholdSweep
----

Tests thresholds: 0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000

Results saved to `build/results/jmh-threshold-sweep/threshold-summary.txt`.

=== Profiling Integration

==== JFR Profiling

Run benchmarks with Java Flight Recorder:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :performance:jmhProfile
----

JFR output saved to `build/results/jmh-profile/benchmark.jfr`.

Analyze with:
[source,bash]
----
jfr print build/results/jmh-profile/benchmark.jfr
jfr summary build/results/jmh-profile/benchmark.jfr
# Or open in JDK Mission Control (jmc)
----

==== GC Profiling

Run with JMH's GC profiler for detailed memory analysis:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :performance:jmhGcProfile
----

==== Memory Tracking Benchmarks

Use `MemoryTrackingState` in benchmarks for detailed heap tracking:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -PbenchInclude=MemoryProfile :performance:jmh
----

=== Baseline Management & CI

==== Saving Baselines

[source,bash]
----
# Run benchmarks
./gradlew :performance:jmh

# Save as baseline
./gradlew :performance:jmhSaveBaseline -PbaselineName=groovy-4.0.x
----

==== Comparing Against Baselines

[source,bash]
----
# Compare against most recent baseline
./gradlew :performance:jmh
./gradlew :performance:jmhCompareBaseline

# Compare against specific baseline
./gradlew :performance:jmhCompareBaseline -PbaselineName=groovy-4.0.x
----

==== CI Integration

Performance benchmarks run automatically via GitHub Actions:

* **On PRs**: Smoke tests for performance-related changes
* **Weekly**: Full benchmark suite
* **On demand**: Via workflow_dispatch with customizable filters

See `.github/workflows/groovy-performance.yml` for details.

=== Tuning Thresholds

The invokedynamic implementation has configurable thresholds:

* `groovy.indy.optimize.threshold` (default: 10000) - Calls before optimization
* `groovy.indy.fallback.threshold` (default: 10000) - Fallbacks before reset

Test with different thresholds:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -PbenchInclude=ThresholdSensitivity :performance:jmh \
    --jvmArgs="-Dgroovy.indy.optimize.threshold=100"
----

=== Benchmark Categories by Use Case

Focus on cold call and request lifecycle:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -PbenchInclude="ColdCall|RequestLifecycle|Template" :performance:jmh
----

==== For Memory Investigation

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -PbenchInclude=Memory :performance:jmh -Pjmh.profilers=gc
